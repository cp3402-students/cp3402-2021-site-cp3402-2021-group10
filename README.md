<!-- Goal of The Project -->
## Goal of The Project

This project aims to make a Custom Theme that both beginners and veterans of WordPress can use. The topic we have chosen is Mobile Application. Design-wise, we have decided to go with a uniform and Morden minimalistic clean look. It is made to be universally used for a broad range of apps while requiring minimal modifications to meet their wants and needs.

To meet our goals and expectation, we made two versions of our theme.

 The first version (G10-Static) can be easily installed simply by dragging and dropping our theme to the upload theme section of your WordPress page, and users can use static templates we have included in our theme to get their site up and running within seconds.

 The second version (G10-Dynamic) requires a bit of knowledge in Database to get it up and run. The difference between this and the previous version is that this is dynamic, meaning all content can be edited via the WordPress Admin panel. The data will be saved in the XML file for you to export and use via the WordPress Export Feature.
